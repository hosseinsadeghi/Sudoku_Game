# Add description for the repository here.

**A Work in progress**
This repositoy is a work in progress for a text based game of sudoku.
It is the result of my personal interest in c++ and sudoku both.

Used OOPS principles in the implementation of the game.

`Grid.h` -> Header file for the Grid class, containing all the definations of the variables and member fucntions of the class.

`Grid.cpp` -> Implementation file containing all the member functions and variables of `Grid` class.

`main.cpp` -> The main file that contains all the objects and function calls that run's the game.

*Still under development*
